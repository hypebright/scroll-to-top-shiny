# Scroll to Top button in Shiny âœ¨ 

Creating a "scroll to top" button in Shiny that becomes visible when the user starts to scroll the page. When the user clicks on the button, the `scrollTop` position gets set back to 0. 

A solution using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript that works in both a simple Shiny layout generated with `fluidPage()` and `bslib` layouts generated with `page_navbar()` and `page_sidebar()`. Note that other layout might require other classes to be targeted. For more information about what class to target you can watch the YouTube video below.
